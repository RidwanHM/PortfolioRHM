                    <img class="card-pic" src="/src/img/Skjermbilde 2023-06-12 kl. 01.32.40.png" alt="Energi picture"/>
                        <div>
                            <p>I had a school project that involved creating a headless CMS for a website. We were given the freedom to choose the topic for our website but had some specific criteria to follow. Firstly, we needed to use a platform to host our list and then utilize that list on our website. Additionally, we were required to create a contact form using JavaScript to validate the inputs. For my project, I wanted to create something that would be interesting for an audience in my age group and reflect my own interests and experiences. Therefore, I decided to make a website about travel destinations, specifically cities that I have personally visited. To begin, I used logo.com to design a logo that suited my website. The logo incorporates "R1," which stands for Ridwan or Rid1, my name.</p>

                               <p>To create the list, I initially attempted to use my own pictures but encountered difficulties, so I opted to use images from unsplash.com instead. I gathered a list of 12 cities, each accompanied by an image and text describing the city. To generate the text, I utilized openai.com to ensure the content was relevant to each post. Regarding the design, I aimed for simplicity to make it easy for readers to navigate. I placed a background image of a beach and island on the index page to make it visually appealing, but for the other pages, I avoided using background images to prevent overwhelming the reader. As part of the project criteria, I included a carousel slider on the homepage, which made the list easy to browse.</p>
                                
                                <p>For coding, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS were used for styling, while JavaScript was responsible for fetching and displaying the list on my pages. On the homepage, I utilized a carousel slider to showcase the city names and images in a horizontal row with arrow buttons for navigation. The blog page displayed the entire list, initially showing 10 cities, and when the "load more" button was pressed, it revealed additional cities. During the development process, I encountered a red underline in the carousel code under "new swiper." This issue arose because I used the Swiper library, and there might have been a syntax problem. However, I tested the code and verified its functionality and use openai.com to check. It said that everything was fine and that I should continue, so I ignored the red underline. Some of the images in the list disappeared whenever I made changes, but this was likely related to the WordPress platform rather than an issue with my code. Overall, I did not encounter any major difficulties with my coding or the project itself.</p>
                                
                                <p>I generated the text for the "About" page using openai.com, which provides information about R1 Travels. Lastly, I implemented a contact form using JavaScript that validated user input, displaying error messages if anything was entered incorrectly. After completing the coding, I used hotjar.com to track user interactions on my website and identify areas for improvement. I discovered that the filter box was causing issues with the list, so I removed it. I also made CSS improvements to enhance the overall user experience, which is why the appearance of my Figma (design) and actual page may differ slightly.</p>

            <h4>Community Sience Museum
            </h4>
                <section class="inside-card">
                    <img class="card-pic" src="/src/img/Skjermbilde 2023-06-12 kl. 02.52.37.png" alt="Energi picture"/>
                        <div>
                            <p>I had a school project that was the final for the semester. We needed to make a website for an online sience museum. We needed to imply everything we learned from the semester and the different course assignments. This ment that we need to design our own design for the website, using figma. We need to code using HTML & CSS. Finally we needed to follow a GHANT chart or a Trello we made.</p>

                                <p>The target audience was for the most kids and young adult. That’s why when I designed the website I made sure that I had that in my mind. I wanted to have fresh colors and as many colors possible for the kids and adults alike could find this museum appealing and up to modern fashion. I had a black-pink linear gradient color that I choose as the main theme. This colors I applied in my header and footer alike. I made sure that the hero image was the most colorful and fancy picture available from the image document and made different «cards for the different events and exhibitions. I made sure that the different pages followed the same concept of colorful cards.</p>
                                
                                <p>The home page have a hero-image that is an eye catcher. This image is followed by a text about the silence museum. I wanted to drift away from the boring gritty looking since museum and give it a fresh setting. That’s why every card on the page got it unique color. Special events and exhibitions is the first to come when you scroll down. This because I meant it was the most special cards and eye-catching for the consumers. This is followed by an exhibition spaces. This is a short summary of the different exhibitions in the museum. The color is also chosen wisely to match the image. Every card have a button inside that lead you direct to the tickets slide.</p>
                                
                                <p>If you press the menu button you get lead to a menu page. This page have four different sections that also can be used as buttons that leads you to the other pages. Explore pages uses the same concept as the home page with the cards and images.</p>
                                
                                <p>Contact & about page also have colorful cards but this sections is without images as it have an image of the museum as an hero image. Here you can see the location, open hours, admission and more. The get involved page follows the same concept as the contact page. Colorful cards without images as it makes it easier to read.</p>
                                
                                <p>The buttons and cards have a hoover effects over it and the buttons change colors when you hoover over it. The cards changes border radius. The tickets section have a form that you can fill out and the press the button. You get directed to the confirmation page and there is a custom made qr-code. If you can scan it, it should lead you to the picture of your ticket. The ticket is inspired from the original tickets for the MUNCH-museum in Oslo,Norway.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>I had an assignment about making a responsive website. I could pick between three different companies to do the design for and I choose Rainydays. I have already designed this website in my design assignment. The starter page got the products, about and contact in it and it goes in column until 1000px breakpoint and it becomes rows. The shopping cart also disappear when in desktop version because I mean it looks finer. The about you page got a big hero picture, also from unsplashed.com. Under it I put the slogan and on top of it I made a slogan of my own. «Rainydays is more than a store, more than a brand, It’s a lifestyle». I made the last word « lifestyle in a bigger font and made it the same blu color as the logo to the branch. Contact us page made it simple with the forms for email, number and type in. Put up a nice image that I found in google that matched the description. Now if you press the menu logo onn the top left corner it will lead you to the main page. The main page got Main menu, products, about us and contact us. If you click on any of these it will lead you to the page. The product page will lead you to the same page as the one you come to if you click on the «storm breaker» jacket on the main menu. There you can see key features, price and choose size and color. If you click on the add cart it will lead you to another page. This page is the checkout page. After the checkout page you get directed to the confirmation page that got a button that leads you back to the starter page. Every page is responsive.nerated the text for the "About" page using openai.com, which provides information about R1 Travels. Lastly, I implemented a contact form using JavaScript that validated user input, displaying error messages if anything was entered incorrectly. After completing the coding, I used hotjar.com to track user interactions on my website and identify areas for improvement. I discovered that the filter box was causing issues with the list, so I removed it. I also made CSS improvements to enhance the overall user experience, which is why the appearance of my Figma (design) and actual page may differ slightly.</p>
